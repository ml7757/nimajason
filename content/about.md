	My name is Awet Iyasu and I was born and raised in Eritrea. For most of my life
	I have lived in Eritrea but at the moment I currently live in Switzerland. While
	I work several jobs to pay for life's necessities, I am a poet at heart and love
	writing in my native language of Tigrinya.

This website is way for me to stay connected with my country, culture, and people.
At the same time, I hope you will be able to share in this experience through my
poems and short articles. Current, my content will benefit those who are fluent
in the Tigrinya language. Over time however, it is my intention to translate this content for the benefit of a larger readership.
