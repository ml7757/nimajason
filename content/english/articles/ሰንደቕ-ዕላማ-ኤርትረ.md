## History and symbolism

Between 1935 and 1941, Eritrea and Ethiopia were occupied by the Italians. Before World War II, Eritrea was more developed and prosperous than Ethiopia. \[What is needed\] is that when Italy was defeated in the war, Ethiopia returned to a wayward monarchy before Italy, and Eritrea was granted a British colonial rule by the United Nations in 1949.

After the invention of Arab nationalism in the 1940s, the Muslim section of Eritrea saw a demand for independence from British rule, saying that Ethiopia tried to become its own, calling the Eritrean government a "lost province." They presented: a Christian site will be integrated with Ethiopia; The Islamic State to Sudan, which in 1950 issued an agreement with Ethiopia that it would be established in the Federation of Autonomous Eritrea after international debate and the intervention of allied forces.

On September 15, 1952, Eritrea became independent of British rule \[5\] and became an independent part of Ethiopia. It was designed with a blue background, and at the time, the flag was in the middle of an olive crown, a symbol of peace, and the ornament surrounded a plant that represented six Eritrean administrative departments. When the eruption of civil war in Eritrea in 1961 \[7\] Ethiopian Emperor Haileslasse banned the Eritrean flag, arms skirts and all other government seals from public places.

The Eritrean People's Liberation Front fought for independence and in January 1977 the party received its own official flag, the current Eritrean flag resembling the official flag of the party. \[8\] The flag had three triangles—red, blue, and green—and the yellow star in the red triangle represented the rich mineral wealth of the country, with five points indicating unity, liberty, justice, democracy, and development.

\[9\] When Eritrea was declared an independent country, the flag was adjusted and the first official hooks were held on May 24, 1993. In 1995, the gold crown symbol replaced the 1952 Flag of the Eritrean People's Liberation, and in 1995 the number of leaves of the crown was measured—the 30 leaves represent the years they spent in the Civil War before independence. The length of the flag was changed from 23 to 12.

Eritrea's official currency in 1997 contained six native animals, and in the censorship, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front showed fighters raising the national flag and the English slogan "Freedom, Equality, and Justice."

## Explanation

The Eritrean flag is divided into two right triangles, based on hooks pointing to the side of the fly: the top triangle is green and the lower triangle is blue and yellow vertical olive branches are surrounded by olive wings on the heel of the triangle.

\[11\] The green represents the country's agriculture and livestock, blue for many seas, and red with 30 leaves that correspond to the thirty years of the struggle for independence.
