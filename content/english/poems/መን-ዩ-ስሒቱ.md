**My money I sweat for, my covenant I made**

**To surrender my honour**

**To surrender your honour**

**You were being you and did it yourself, to bear the guilt with guilt and stir it up.**

**Since you told me, I've deceived myself**

**What am I going to do with his conversation!?**

**I'm hooked on it because I like it**

**I've said a lot and not worn,**

**But if I ask you, you will tell me**

**If it's my own medicine**

**I tune my tongue by saying.**

**You've been... a victim!**

**But you don't tell the truth, let it be your healing reward so that you can live on this earth**

**For this short life you have, don't dream in your style of thinking**

**Don't dream in your style of thinking, God doesn’t like a liar who says he is**

**He saw us in trouble, He heals us when we are sick,**

**He who examines our hearts, tells our thoughts, he's even in front of you, all the time**

**If your head and tongue become numb, for those who know exactly how that happened**

**Don't cheat or lie to him, to me, man, if you say too much**

**I’ll conceive everything, I’ll believe everything in you and for all your being, I’ve made a covenant with you.**

**But if you care. I don’t investigate, like the dear God**

**Because I am composed of body and soul**

**I added to the problem, I see and I live so I believe**

****But now I have fallen! When you fall in error.**
