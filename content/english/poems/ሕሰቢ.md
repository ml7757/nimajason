**Think of gold from cloth**

**I’m your life partner, your covenant**

**I'm all for your condition**

**From being struck by a stranger,**

**But you don't care, I'll raise you**

**About myself, if you think about it**

**If you do faqia, do it and pay attention**

**From coveting my cave, if you were restrained**

**Made thought, made heart**

**Our love would advance, did desire**

**It’s an idea, a little idea**

**Advancing, raising, with mankind**

**Think of it seriously, life is a network**

**A fantasy to find, a narrowness to lose,**

**Think of is as doing it**

**Thoughtfully analyzed, piercing the heart**

**Rather than being, let’s be impatient**

**Thank you for what we have, get up and think.**

**He lives by thought, for a life of living**

**Arare Taame, the threshold to which we move**

**It’s an idea, a dialogue**

**Right mistakes made by correcting them**

**It’s the head that thinks, do the right thing.**
