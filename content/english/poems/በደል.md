**Are you being bullied and wronged**

**You're the only one who straightens up and shadows**

**O all-bearing, my valley climb,**

**To qualm my confusion with Haita**

**Lest I dream of a solution to my torment**

**You are the solution, the security of my soul forever,**

**O cleanser of all, my valley is uphill**

**You're being bullied and raped!**

**O Giver of all, whom I call my choice**

**My world loves me, it cools my fever**

**Tradition is my reward, if it is in you**

**May your enemy be wronged, since my longing is tempted**

**Let your enemy sin, and you do not sin**

**Always have time, for me**

**To wander in my flesh**

**So that I can shelter myself.**
