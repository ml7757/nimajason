**Victory, as its name suggests, is tireless and non-white**

**Is it from God, he’s forced to go through it**

**Suffering, for the sake of humanity**

**Destroyer of misery, like the honey my repair**

**Years of progress, even if it’s ugly.**

**Victory! It’s a victory to achieve**

**Trouble! It’s a problem, slow**

**Good luck! Prosperity is a pleasure**

**When there is patience, the symbol of Kulamla.**

**On the shore, the cliffs of the sea**

**There’s a sweet breeze, a chilly cold**

**Sometimes sweet, sometimes cold**

**That’s how success is, it’s enduring with patience.**

**Let me relate the two, as opposed to silence**

**From man-to-man, Bihitu silent**

**He’ll achieve it! It’s his victory**

**Starting from scratch, it’s a hundred.**
