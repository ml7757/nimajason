**Bear with me! He gave birth to Ihta**

**With no one to listen to him, he traded grief**

**Sorrow by his sorrow, depriving her of deafness**

**Stored in recognition, to be filled with his image.**

**As he said, she was tired of crying**

**His belief that I have, eternal love**

**He is afraid of the flesh, and is weary of thirst**

**By listening to the miracle**

**Her thirst is over, her patience is gone**

**Ufta is full, love is thin**

**They have lost their wages, and slavery has increased**

**Would a white heart be dark, covered with dust.**

**I get it from God**

**By covenant of love, since I found confusing**

**The world is exhausted, lust has increased and sin has increased**

**The melody of the melody, the farewell of Reisa**

**IT HAPPENED! Repeatedly, out of the Mosaic Law**

**Since the thirst of man is over,**

**God’s law is his punishment.**

**Come and forgive those who have been wronged**

**We said it’s even, the law of our God**

**Let’s get used to forgiveness, rather than suffer in silence**

**Crying is a disease, exhausting yourself**

**While you remember it, rather than advise it alone**

**Sharing is the cure, born of repentance**

**All alone in sickness, by the irony of nature**

**You are a human being, don't complain about trouble.**

**By the law of God, if you don't go**

**Keep the Ten Commandments to yourself**

**Repent, according to the law of the Creator**

**To relieve fatigue, tension is your credit.**
