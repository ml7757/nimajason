Love is not the word of the world

She graduates to enjoy it

You get angry at the mourning

Making your sunset

You will make your drizzle,

What you invest in, you spend the day

A Shining Slope

You die this tomorrow, you die in the dust, you are put to death.

So don't make the word of the world

Savor love as much as love.

When you are in the land,

Condemn the Word of the World like a scandal

To live! Live with life

Love is sweet and free.
