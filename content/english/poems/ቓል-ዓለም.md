**Love is not a word-world**

**You bless to rejoice in that**

**You get angry at the sadness**

**Let your sun go down**

**To make your rain fall**

**What you spend is what you spend**

**The worst-best living**

**You die for this tomorrow,**

**Bury it in the dust**

**So don't make it word of mouth**

**Enjoy love as love.**

**While you're on this earth**

**Condemn the Word-of-the-World as a shame**

**To live! Live with Life**

**Love is sweet, love freely.**
