To look like you!

Likened to work

Resemble your mother with frustre

Flowers, dewdrops,

You shewit, the twig of a man,

If so, do you?

In the adversament, I swore at him, and i was going to spend it.

I feel empowered and sweaty and dewy

My sandals, my sandals, my weak ones,

If you will show me water-sucking, emoticons to the world.
