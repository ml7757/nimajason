**To pretend!**

**Similar in functionality**

**Imagine your mother by nature**

**You are the flower of the shadow of the cloud**

**Oh, sweet son of Sable,**

**If I see you...**

**You scare me early, I untie it to hide**

**I feel strong, sweating and raining**

**Come on, Shame, to shade my weakness**

**To satisfy my thirst for water, imitate your world.**
