**It was you! You were... my cover-up**

**Formerly in my goodness
My Protective Caregiver**

**While your on my mind, it's not a sin**

**But you've changed now,
You climbed on my lap,**

**A daily sind to rob and plunder,
You wander, anointed and swear**

**To roam around, to wander with excuses**

**You have abandoned your goal to desire noise,
bearer of guilt, becoming a cave-of-guilt**

**You made a housekeeper, and you gave her a mother
Don't campaign, don't advance, don't clean, don't lie**

**Running around, to make their coffee**

**They don't know what to bring, a pile of sin**

**Hanging their pearls, while they pray**

**For your sake and their sake
Before sin came to them, they knew you were going out,**

**When you're a sin...**

**You are a wife-of-sin**

**To look like a heroine-lion**

**You died in wandering, you changed Reisa
You want a funeral director, with a dead life,**

**I will pray for your mother every morning
They prayed a lot that she would not get involved in gambling
To get value for it, your input and output**

**To live in your body, in the body of your home**

**Don't bring them offence, change your behavior**

**They beg and pray, for the one who delivers the prayer**

**You to be squeezed, to satisfy your desires**

**You're stuck, in a job without a vision,**

**You're rushing.
Along the street, the city will be covered**

**If you find someone, who wants your fault**

**Goof-goof found, like you
Your mother did not believe him, swearing to their children**

**They enter and swear to it, with their prayers**

**She doesn’t care about guilt, she’s a faithful daughter**

**They go in to be told to swear**

**They swear, they don't care about guilt**

**On their daughter, on the woman-of-the-sin**

**To beautify her negativity, farther and nearer**

**They pass by without accusation with their faith,**

**Defiles her who accuses her of not having them**

**Instead, he passes her by arguing**

**Also pray, Mother Itai Gergsa.**
