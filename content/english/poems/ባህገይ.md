**What did I find along the way?**

**What did he find for me in the country?**

**Wherever you travel, to go without returning**

**You refused to come back, and you became my treasure.**

**Come on, come back,**

**Love, do not break your covenant**

**Love is the pillar that sets mankind apart**

**So think, learn from the past,**

**My faith is the faith of truth**

**My covenant is a lightning bolt**

**You graduated knowing it was**

**Not for the beholder, but for my desire to shine**

**Starting outside me, shining inside me,**

**My desire has persuaded me to wait for your return**

**I counted the years, making commitments**

**If I get my income**

**Hah’s waited, I’ve been patient,**

**Without getting everything, I was in between**

**I was left deep in the water, empty-handed.**
