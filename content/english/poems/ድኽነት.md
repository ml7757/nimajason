**If I keep money in my pocket**

**If I squeeze money in my pocket**

**It will it put me down and crush me, my world**

**My mouth is shut in silence**

**Not to remember, not to meditate, but for want**

**I was forced not to live by poverty**

**I speak to the world, it speaks to me**

**I replied that I was changed and found**

**To take me out of her womb**

**If I miss something, if I get into the tree.**

**I wake up, and I am in a dream**

**Without wasting time, I was set free today**

**To be untied and untied, to become a reality**

**I pray to God, to end my poverty.**
