**Where we didn't clean our sweat**

**We didn’t blame ourselves for it**

**Foreigners swim in it**

**They swim against each other**

**Time is over for us, by the way**

**It was meant to be delivered to us.**

**To my people, the people of my country!**

**That we did not shed his blood and sweat**

**It’s even called the Red-Sea by his blood**

**From ages ago, he was covered with his blood**

**Even in the 90’s, enough is above all.**

**Telling what to witness!**

**He’s in the frenzy, he’s accountable for the frenzy**

**Twalet testifies, he's a prisoner himself**

**Baylul’s also responsible, all the records**

**Let Erie’s story unfold, she’ll describe the picture**

**Picture of land and sea, paid tribute.**
