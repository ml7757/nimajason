**Morning and sunset**

**It gets dark**

**The stars shine**

**Darkness is lifted**

**The sun shone and it was morning**

**The sun set and it was evening**

**The abyss filled and surrounded**

**Let the stars do their part**

**To remove the guardian of darkness,**

**Life is also a migration**

**Some like it, others find it difficult**

**Far at a distance, not close by**

**Accompanied by the sound of tears**

**Escape the field and run**

**It's not even a smile**

**Water of peace, thirst for the blind**

**Deceptive Fruit of Income by grace**

**It requires a ladder, run to get there**

**Don't be afraid to take a break professionally.**
