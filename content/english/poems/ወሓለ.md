**A modest and skilled woman**

**Her future demands a lot**

**To attend weddings and funerals**

**To bear a child, to bring forth a child,**

**A skilled woman.**

**Every friend of hers, every seeker of her**

**For marriage and life, wishful thinking**

**I’m so excited about life, the essence of life**

**By distributing gifts, without a flaw,**

**Being skilled, she replaced her mother**

**She’s talked to people, she’s gathered people**

**She poured grain-water, gathered people**

**A skilled, blessed woman.**
