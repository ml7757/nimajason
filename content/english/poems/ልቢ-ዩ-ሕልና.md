**Throughout history**

**From any curtain**

**A heart without a conscience**

**Hopes from Pregnancy**

**The Effort of Many People**

**The Shame from being dominated by conscience.**

**What is the heart?**

**To live the heart’s setting**

**Conscience from the least disturbing**

**Man to Man, by Man**

**From parents to the excuse for prosperity**

**Which is better for a wonderful conscience**

**Why does it bring us prosperity?**

**Because, it’s the conscience that takes care of the heart**

**Because, it’s the heart that seeks the conscience**

**Between two, married effort**

**Conscience combined, it’s heart-breaking**

**Man-kind to live, with a conscience of dignity.**

**With a history that will never die**

**Indelible for debt, narrated by conscience**

**Heaven-raising, conscientiously stage**

**When the heart analyzes it, it’s round and rising**

**So the heart is the conscience, that marries the generation**

**Conscience without heart, don't go for man**

**Listen without vision, don't analyze and judge**

**Without a heart of conscience, we cannot live**

**It’s the heart that reveals the conscience, to live**

**Let's shout man-of-heart, let's go for conscience.**
