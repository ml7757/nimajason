**Your snow’s white, like water-milk**

**You’re dry! Pure as river-water**

**Are you away, my cousin near**

**You’re hiding, across the hill**

**You give freedom, you gave your soul**

**Because you are my bone and flesh**

**For this exaltation of mine, which you have raised to heaven**

**You shed your blood and spread it**

**For this life of mine, you became a ransom**

**Regardless of gender, I call you my brother**

**I to exist, you who were not**

**You gave me life, without you**

**Your reward without paying you.**
